- Visual feedback for upload progress and file validation

### Step 2: Persona Definition
Define the user persona who will analyze the documents:

- *Role/Position*: Specific job title or academic position
- *Expertise Areas*: Technical skills and knowledge domains
- *Focus Areas*: Specific interests and analytical priorities
- *Experience Level*: Background and years of relevant experience

*Sample Personas:*
- PhD Researcher in Computational Biology
- Investment Analyst
- Undergraduate Chemistry Student

### Step 3: Job-to-be-Done Specification
Specify the concrete task to be accomplished:

- *Task Description*: Clear, specific objective
- *Expected Output*: Format and type of deliverable
- *Priority Level*: Urgency and importance (Low/Medium/High/Urgent)
- *Timeline*: Expected completion timeframe

### Step 4: AI Processing
The system simulates intelligent document analysis through:

- Document parsing and text extraction
- Content analysis and section identification
- Persona-driven relevance matching
- Importance ranking based on job requirements
- Content extraction and refinement

### Step 5: Results Analysis
View comprehensive results in multiple formats:

- *Overview*: Summary statistics and key metrics
- *Extracted Sections*: Ranked document sections with importance scores
- *Sub-Analysis*: Detailed content analysis with relevance scores
- *JSON Output*: Complete structured data for export

## üìä Output Format

The system generates structured JSON output matching the challenge specifications:
